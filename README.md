# Sign Language Detection using Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to detect and interpret sign language gestures using Python, specifically designed for implementation on a Raspberry Pi. The system utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning to recognize hand gestures and translate them into corresponding text or actions, making sign language more accessible and interactive.

## Features

### 1. Hand Gesture Recognition

- **Computer Vision Techniques:** Utilize OpenCV for hand detection and gesture recognition.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features from hand movements and positions.

### 2. Machine Learning Model

- **Model Training:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., CNN or SVM) on labeled sign language gesture datasets.
- **Gesture Classification:** Recognize and classify hand gestures into corresponding signs.

### 3. Raspberry Pi Implementation

- **Integration with Raspberry Pi:** Optimize the code and dependencies for running on Raspberry Pi hardware.
- **Real-time Detection:** Enable real-time sign language gesture recognition using the Pi camera.

## Installation and Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)
- Raspberry Pi setup (Raspbian OS, Pi Camera)
